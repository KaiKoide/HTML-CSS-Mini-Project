            <h2>What is a sexuality?</h2>
            <p>A person’s sexuality, or sexual orientation, determines whom they do or do not feel attraction toward. This attraction is typically sexual or romantic.</p>
            <p>Sexual attraction describes a person’s desire to have sex or form a sexual relationship with other people. It often also describes physical attraction, or lack thereof, toward others.</p>
            <p>Romantic attraction can describe a person’s expression of love within a relationship. This relationship does not have to be sexual, and a person does not have to experience both romantic and sexual attraction to have a sexuality.</p>
            <p>There are a lot of sexual orientations, and people who identify with one or more may find that their sexuality changes over time. This is perfectly normal — a person’s orientation can be fluid.</p>
